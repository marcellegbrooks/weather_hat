Weather Hat

Marcelle Brooks
March 2024

Using servo motors, a temperature sensor, and a raindrop sensor, 
this device is meant as an updated actuated everyday item. It can lower or raise
ear flaps depending on the sensed temperature as well as automatically start 
mini windshield wipers on glasses when it senses raindrops. 

You can find Arduino code in the folder full_weather_hat, circuit details in the 
folder circuit, and 3D models for both the hat and the glasses wipers in the 3D
model folder. 

The Arduino code programs an Arduino Uno board.
